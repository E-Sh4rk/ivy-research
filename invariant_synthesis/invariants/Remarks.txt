Invariants added manually: form of an implication
Invariants added with Ivy: less intuitive, longer and use only conjunctions
--> Can be improved by adding heuristics ? (by analysing the conjecture and the code)

More frequent invariants: injectivity of a function/relation, ... -> A < B, inclusion/equality of two data structures (one from the implementation, one from the specification)

Specifications that can't be expressed with first order logic are checked using a monitor.
Then a safety property can check that the values of the impl are coherent with the predictions of the monitor.
