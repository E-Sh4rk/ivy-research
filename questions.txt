difference property/conjecture
exact semantic isolate ... with ...
semantic of derived keyword ?

how Ivy differentiate specification and implementation?
(object impl / object spec)
How should I do to define a relation and code only for specification purposes (not implementable)?

function definitions:
(example from collections.ivy)
 function gap(k:key.iter.t,m:key.iter.t) =
              forall L. ~(key.iter.ahead(L,k) & key.iter.done(L,m) & contains(L))
Is this only used to evaluate the function or is this definition also taken into account for specifications?
If taken into account for spec, why is this example working in collections.ivy (it seems not repl)?
