Presentation of IVy
	Context
	Decidable Logics
		EPR
		FAI
	The language
	Automating, interactive tools

Research directions
	Make EPR
		Fragmentation
		Adding relations
	Typing (session types)
	Invariant synthesis

Session types (optional)
	Why adding typing?
	Example of session types
	Limits
		Decidability limits (interpreted logic)
		Modeling limits (non-linearity)

Invariant synthesis
	Finite Model Property
	Counterexample generalization (current method)
	Limits (universal only, sometimes bad generalization)
	My method (code analysis)
		Code analysis
		Case when some marks are model-dependent

Conclusion
	Advantages compared to other methods
		Former counterexample generalization
		Abstract code analysis (with weakest precondition)
		Focus on: complexity of formula, terminate finitely?, shape of formulas generated
	What remains to be done
		Formal guarantees/characterization
		Usable/integrated implementation
