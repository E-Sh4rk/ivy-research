Presentation of IVy
	Context
	Decidable Logics
		EPR (with Finite Model Property)
		FAU
	The language
	Deciding IVy
	Automation, interactive tools

Research directions
	Make EPR
		Fragmentation
		Adding relations
	Typing (session types)
	Invariant synthesis

Session types (optional)
	Why adding typing?
	Example of session types
	Limits
		Decidability limits (interpreted logic)
		Modeling limits (non-linearity)

Invariant synthesis
	Using weakest precondition
	Counterexample generalization (current method)
	Limits (universal only, sometimes bad generalization)

My contribution (code analysis)
	Code analysis
	Model-dependent marks
	Advantages compared to other methods
		Former counterexample generalization
		Abstract code analysis (with weakest precondition)
		Focus on: complexity of formula, terminate finitely?, shape of formulas generated

Conclusion
	What remains to be done
		Formal guarantees/characterization
		Usable/integrated implementation
