\chapter{Presentation of IVy}

    \section{Context}

    As distributed programs become more and more widespread, their verification is a major challenge.

    The general purpose of my internship is to make the certification of those programs easier.
    Certifying a program consists in writing some specifications (in our case, some safety properties), and then proving than the program satisfy them.
    Several languages and tools already exist for that:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proof-assistants (Coq, Agda, etc.):
        The user has to manually write the proof (altough he can benefit from some help).
        It is a long and complicated process, but once the proof is complete, the proof assistant will always accept it
        if it is correct.
        \item SMT-solver based tools (dafny, F*, etc.):
        Specifications are automatically checked using a SMT-solver. This process is undecidable in the general case,
        so there are 3 possible outputs:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Yes, the program matches the specifications
            \item No, the program doesn't match the specifications (sometimes a counterexample can be provided)
            \item I don't know whether the program matches the specifications or not.
        \end{itemize}
        When this last case occurs, the user has to reformulate the specifications differently or to explicitely write some intermediate properties (like inductive invariants)
        in order to help the SMT-solver.
    \end{itemize}

    IVy is a language that allows the user to certify its program using a SMT-solver based approach.
    However, unlike most of its concurrents, IVy restricts the language and the logic used for specifications
    in order to be able to check the program in a decidable way.

    This approach has many advantages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Once the program is written and specified in an accepted logic, it can be checked more easily:
        the checker can always decide whether the program is correct or not, and give a counterexample if it is not.
        \item Our code, specifications and proof indications are not dependent on some heuristics/specificities of the SMT-solver used,
        and so we don't need any specific knowledge.
        \item If a program has been checked using a certain version IVy, it can also be checked with
        any future version (because it does not depend on any heuristic).
    \end{itemize}
    
    The main disadvantage is that the user is forced to specify its program in a decidable fragment of first order logic:
    it can force him to rethink the architecture of its code, to fragment its code by creating intermediate abstract modules,
    to add some `ghost' variables, etc.
